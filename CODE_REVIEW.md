# Code Review: feed.me

## Summary

The `feed.me` project is a well-architected RSS feed reader with good separation between the Rust backend (`spacefeeder`) and Zola frontend. The codebase has solid error handling, modularity, and test coverage.

## Remaining Improvements

### 1. **Duplicate Detection and Deduplication**

*   **Current State:** No handling of duplicate articles across feeds
*   **Recommendation:** Implement content fingerprinting to:
    - Detect when multiple feeds syndicate the same article
    - Show each article only once with attribution to all sources
    - Track cross-posted content patterns for analytics

### 2. **Feed Health Monitoring**

*   **Current State:** Failed feeds are reported but not tracked over time
*   **Recommendation:** Add persistent feed health tracking:
    - Record failure patterns and last successful fetch times
    - Auto-disable consistently failing feeds with notification
    - Provide feed reliability statistics in the UI

### 3. **Performance Metrics and Caching**

*   **Current State:** No caching mechanism for feed content
*   **Recommendation:** Implement intelligent caching:
    - Use ETags and Last-Modified headers for conditional requests
    - Cache parsed feed data with configurable TTLs
    - Add metrics for fetch times, parse times, and data volumes

## Future Functionality (Prioritized by Value/Effort)

### 1. **Publish to Package Managers** 
*High Value, Low Effort* **[Requires Human]**

Publishing to `crates.io` and `homebrew` would dramatically increase accessibility. Requires account setup and release process configuration.

### 2. **Interactive Article Management**
*High Value, Medium Effort*

Add client-side JavaScript for:
- Mark articles as read/unread
- Star/bookmark favorites
- Hide/archive articles
- Persist state in localStorage initially, with option for server-side storage

### 3. **Full-Text Search**
*High Value, Medium Effort*

Implement search capabilities using `tantivy` or similar:
- Index article titles, descriptions, and metadata
- Support advanced queries with filters by date, author, tier
- Enable saved searches as dynamic feeds

### 4. **Smart Categorization with Tags**
*High Value, High Effort* **[ML Components Require Human]**

Evolve beyond the tier system:
- Auto-extract tags from feed metadata
- Support user-defined tags on feeds and articles
- Generate tag-based views and related article suggestions
- Consider ML-based topic clustering for automatic categorization

### 5. **Multiple Output Formats**
*Medium Value, Low Effort*

Extend beyond JSON to support:
- Direct HTML generation (eliminating Zola dependency)
- Markdown export for note-taking apps
- RSS/OPML generation for feed sharing
- SQLite for persistent storage and queries

### 6. **Web-Based Feed Management UI**
*Medium Value, High Effort* **[Requires Human for UX Design]**

Build an embedded web interface:
- Visual feed management with drag-and-drop organization
- Real-time feed preview before adding
- Bulk operations for feed management
- Statistics dashboard showing reading patterns

### 7. **Content Enrichment Pipeline**
*Low Value, High Effort*

Advanced processing features:
- Full-text extraction from article links
- Readability scoring and reading time estimates
- Language detection and translation options
- Sentiment analysis for content mood tracking

## Architecture Considerations

### Potential Migration to Async

Consider migrating from `rayon` to `tokio` for async I/O operations. This would:
- Reduce thread overhead for network operations
- Enable WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Improve resource utilization for high feed counts

### Plugin System

Design a plugin architecture for extensibility:
- Custom feed processors for non-standard formats
- User-defined content filters and transformations
- Integration points for external services

## Conclusion

Focus on items 2-3 (Interactive Article Management, Full-Text Search) for immediate impact, as these are implementable by AI agents and provide significant user value. Items marked **[Requires Human]** need human oversight for account setup, UX decisions, or ML model selection.
