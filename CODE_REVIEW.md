# Code Review: feed.me

This document contains a code review of the `feed.me` project. It highlights areas for improvement in terms of maintainability, extendability, correctness, and potential for future functionality.

## High-Level Summary

The `feed.me` project is a great start for a personal feed reader. The separation of concerns between the Rust-based `spacefeeder` tool and the Zola static site generator is a good design choice. The use of a `justfile` provides a clear and simple way to interact with the project.

This review will provide suggestions to further improve the project, focusing on making it more robust, easier to extend, and more user-friendly.

## Rust Backend (`spacefeeder`)

The `spacefeeder` tool is the core of the project. Here are some suggestions for improvement:




### 4. **Configuration Improvements for Better Onboarding**

*   **Observation:** The configuration is currently handled through a `spacefeeder.toml` file in the project root. This requires users to manually create and configure the file.
*   **Suggestion:** To improve the user onboarding experience, consider the following:
    *   **Self-Initializing Global Config:** On the first run, if no configuration file is found, automatically create a default `config.toml` in a standard location like `~/.config/feed.me/config.toml` (using a crate like `dirs`). This removes the manual setup step for the user.
    *   **Include Default Feeds:** Pre-populate the default configuration file with a few interesting RSS/Atom feeds. This serves two purposes: it demonstrates the tool's functionality immediately and also allows you to endorse and showcase a variety of content sources.


## Zola Frontend

The Zola frontend is simple and effective. Here are some suggestions for improvement:



### 3. **Improve Accessibility**

*   **Observation:** The HTML is simple and clean, which is good for accessibility.
*   **Suggestion:** To further improve accessibility, consider adding ARIA attributes to the HTML elements, especially for the navigation and the articles. For example, you could add `role="navigation"` to the `nav` element and `role="article"` to the `article` elements.

## Future Functionality

Here are some ideas for future functionality that would make the project more successful and easier for others to consume:

### 1. **Advanced, Multi-Source Categorization with Tags**

*   **Observation:** The current tier system (`new`, `like`, `love`) is a good starting point, but a more flexible, multi-faceted approach to categorization would be more powerful.
*   **Suggestion:** Implement a tagging system that allows for more granular and user-defined categorization. This system could source tags from multiple places:
    *   **From the Feed:** Automatically ingest tags or categories directly from the RSS/Atom feed if they are provided.
    *   **Inferred from Content:** Use NLP techniques to infer tags from the article's content.
    *   **User-Defined:** Allow users to manually add their own tags to feeds and individual articles.

    This would enable users to:
    *   **Tag Feeds:** Assign tags to entire feeds (e.g., `rust`, `ai`, `design`).
    *   **Tag Individual Articles:** Allow users to add tags to individual articles, regardless of the feed they came from.
    *   **Generate Tag-Based Views:** Automatically generate pages or sections for each tag, creating custom views of the content (e.g., a page for all articles tagged with `ai`).

    This would transform the project from a simple feed reader into a more powerful personal knowledge base.

### 2. **Integrate HTML Rendering in the Rust Software**

*   **Observation:** The project currently uses Zola for HTML rendering.
*   **Suggestion:** To simplify the project and make it easier to consume, consider integrating the HTML rendering directly into the `spacefeeder` tool. You could use a templating engine like `askama` or `tera` to render the HTML. This would eliminate the need for a separate static site generator and make the project a single, self-contained binary.

### 3. **Add Support for More Output Formats**

*   **Observation:** The `spacefeeder` tool currently only outputs JSON.
*   **Suggestion:** Add support for other output formats, such as HTML, Markdown, or even a local SQLite database. This would make the tool more versatile and allow users to consume the feed data in different ways.

### 4. **Create a Web-based UI for Managing Feeds**

*   **Observation:** The feeds are currently managed through the command line.
*   **Suggestion:** To make the project more user-friendly, consider creating a simple web-based UI for adding, removing, and managing feeds. This could be a separate tool or integrated into the `spacefeeder` binary and served on a local web server.

### 5. **Add a "Like" or "Save for Later" Feature**

*   **Observation:** The current "tier" system is a good start for categorizing feeds.
*   **Suggestion:** To make the feed reader more interactive, consider adding a "like" or "save for later" feature. This would allow users to mark individual articles they are interested in and view them later. This would likely require a more persistent storage mechanism than just JSON files, such as a local SQLite database.

### 6. **Publish to a Package Manager**

*   **Observation:** The `spacefeeder` tool is installed using `cargo install`.
*   **Suggestion:** To make the tool easier to install and update, consider publishing it to a package manager like `crates.io` or `homebrew`. This would make it more accessible to a wider audience.

## Conclusion

The `feed.me` project is a promising start for a personal feed reader. By addressing the points in this code review, you can make the project more robust, extendable, and user-friendly. The suggestions for future functionality provide a roadmap for how you can continue to evolve the project and make it even more successful.
