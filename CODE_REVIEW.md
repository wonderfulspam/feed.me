# Code Review: feed.me

## Summary

The `feed.me` project is a well-architected RSS feed reader with good separation between the Rust backend (`spacefeeder`) and Zola frontend. The codebase has solid error handling, modularity, and test coverage. Current performance is good (23 feeds in ~2 seconds) and user feedback indicates the system works well for its intended purpose.

## Key Lessons from Implementation Experience

**Avoid premature optimization:** Complex solutions like duplicate detection and feed health tracking were investigated but provided minimal value in practice. The existing error reporting is clear and sufficient. Current performance is already acceptable.

**Focus on user-facing gaps:** The most valuable improvement was enhanced onboarding (`spacefeeder init`) because it addressed a real user friction point - getting started.

## High-Priority Improvements (Real Gaps)

### 1. **Interactive Article Management**
*Current Gap:* No way to track reading progress or bookmark interesting articles  
*User Value:* Core RSS reader functionality that users expect  
*Implementation:* Client-side JavaScript with localStorage persistence
- Mark articles as read/unread
- Star/bookmark favorites  
- Hide/archive articles
- Simple state management without server complexity

### 2. **Package Manager Distribution** **[Requires Human]**
*Current Gap:* Installation requires git clone + cargo build  
*User Value:* Dramatically lowers adoption barrier  
*Implementation:* Publish to crates.io, potentially homebrew
- One-command installation for users
- Automatic updates and version management

### 3. **Full-Text Search**
*Current Gap:* No way to find articles by content  
*User Value:* Essential for managing large article collections  
*Implementation:* Local search index (tantivy or similar)
- Search titles, descriptions, and metadata
- Filter by date, author, tier
- Saved searches as dynamic feeds

## Medium-Priority Improvements (Nice-to-Have)

### 1. **Multiple Output Formats**
*Current State:* Tightly coupled to Zola + JSON  
*Potential Value:* Flexibility for different use cases
- Direct HTML generation (eliminate Zola dependency)
- Markdown export for note-taking workflows
- SQLite output for advanced querying

### 2. **Enhanced Feed Discovery**
*Current State:* Manual URL entry only  
*Potential Value:* Easier feed management
- Auto-discover feeds from website URLs (expand current `find-feed`)
- OPML import/export improvements
- Popular feed recommendations

### 3. **Web-Based Management UI** **[Requires Human for UX Design]**
*Current State:* TOML file editing only  
*Potential Value:* More user-friendly configuration
- Visual feed management interface
- Real-time feed preview
- Drag-and-drop organization

## Low-Priority Items (Theoretical Value)

These were investigated but provide minimal practical benefit:

• **Feed Health Monitoring** - Existing error output is sufficient for personal use
• **Duplicate Detection** - No duplicates observed in practice across typical feed collections  
• **Performance Caching** - Current speed is already acceptable for personal RSS reading
• **Content Enrichment** - Complex processing for limited user benefit
• **Smart Categorization** - Current tier system works well for personal curation

## Architecture Considerations

### Incremental Improvements Over Rewrites
The current architecture works well. Focus on additive features rather than major refactoring.

### Client-Side State Management  
For interactive features, prioritize localStorage over server-side complexity to maintain the tool's simplicity.

### Maintain Unix Philosophy
Keep the CLI tool focused and composable rather than building a monolithic application.

## Implementation Priority

1. **Interactive Article Management** - Addresses core user workflow gap
2. **Package Distribution** - Reduces adoption friction  
3. **Search** - Scales with growing article collections
4. **Output Format Flexibility** - Enables new use cases

Focus on closing real user experience gaps rather than solving theoretical problems or optimizing already-acceptable performance.
