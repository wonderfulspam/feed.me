										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Suzie Prince, Head of Product at Atlaasian recently spoke with Abi Noda, CEO at DX, and Andrew Boyagi, Head of DevOps Evangelism at Atlassian, about how AI is changing software development. They shared valuable insights on the best practices for using generative AI (GenAI) tools on your developer teams, how to get value from developer portals, and the latest approaches for measuring developer productivity.</p>



<p>Here are five key takeaways from this conversation on strategies for leveraging AI to boost developer productivity and experience.</p>



<p><strong>Set realistic expectations for GenAI tools</strong></p>



<p>The promise of GenAI tools, such as automated code generation and pull request descriptions, has excited the developer community. These tools have the potential to reduce repetitive tasks and free up developers&#8217; time for more critical work.</p>



<p>However, Abi and Andrew caution against overestimating their immediate impact. While these tools can alleviate some of the toil associated with development, they also require time for correcting inaccuracies. <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/artificial-intelligence/a-guide-to-adopting-ai-features-in-your-company">Organizations need to carefully assess the actual benefits and effectiveness of these tools</a> within their specific contexts to ensure they deliver meaningful productivity improvements. To set realistic expectations and effectively assess the benefits of GenAI tools, organizations can follow these steps:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="1">
<li>Define clear objectives and goals such as reducing code review time or improving code quality.</li>



<li>Establish baselines by gathering current performance data on metrics like code review time and deployment frequency.</li>



<li>Start with small pilot groups and gradually expand to manage expectations and mitigate risks.</li>



<li>Combine qualitative feedback (e.g., developer satisfaction surveys) with quantitative metrics (e.g., reduced code review time).</li>



<li>Continuously monitor performance and gather feedback to make necessary adjustments.</li>



<li>Break down the implementation into incremental goals to maintain realistic expectations.</li>



<li>Provide training and ongoing support to help developers effectively use GenAI tools.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>Invest in training and adoption strategies</strong></p>



<p>​​Providing developers with GenAI tools is just the first step. To truly reap the benefits, organizations must invest in comprehensive training programs that help developers understand and effectively utilize these tools. Abi emphasized the importance of identifying specific use cases that align with the organization&#8217;s unique environment. For instance, one company might focus on streamlining pull requests, while another might prioritize knowledge curation and discovery. By identifying these use cases that are specific to your organization, developers can maximize the potential of GenAI tools, leading to more significant improvements in their workflows and overall productivity.</p>



<p><strong>Use phased rollouts and pilot groups</strong></p>



<p>A common pitfall that many organizations encounter is the rush to purchase and deploy AI tools en masse without adequate usage studies. Abi and Andrew recommend starting with pilot groups and phased rollouts. This approach allows organizations to study the benefits and identify the most effective use cases within smaller, controlled populations. By understanding the impact of the tools in these settings, organizations can make more informed decisions about broader adoption, reducing the risk of widespread implementation failures.</p>



<p><strong>Quantitative data won’t give you the full story</strong></p>



<p>Many companies introduce AI tools to make devs more productive, and focus on quantitative data like number of pull requests or deployment frequency to measure the increase in productivity. But effective measurement of developer productivity requires a blend of qualitative and quantitative data. While traditional <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/devops/frameworks/devops-metrics">DevOps metrics</a> provide valuable insights, they don’t capture the full scope of developer work.</p>



<p>Abi suggests combining these metrics with qualitative feedback from developers through surveys and direct feedback mechanisms. This holistic approach ensures that the measurements are actually meaningful and actionable, helping organizations identify areas for improvement and track progress over time.</p>



<p>A prime example of<a href="https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Compass-articles/Get-the-data-you-need-to-build-a-better-developer-experience-DX/ba-p/2643931"> how to incorporate qualitative insights into your productivity measurements</a> can be found in Compass. In partnership with DX, Compass offers DevEx 360 surveys designed by the researchers behind DORA and SPACE metrics. These surveys can help identify top opportunities to improve developer job satisfaction and pinpoint factors slowing down development teams. By integrating surveys directly into their workflows, teams can gather comprehensive feedback that complements traditional metrics. This approach helps build a better developer experience by providing a more nuanced understanding of what drives productivity.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="999" height="819" src="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/compass-latest-snapshot.png" alt="" class="wp-image-62260" srcset="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/compass-latest-snapshot.png 999w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/compass-latest-snapshot-300x246.png 300w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/compass-latest-snapshot-600x492.png 600w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/compass-latest-snapshot-768x630.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px" /></figure>



<p>Dan Tao, Head of Engineering for DevOps products at Atlassian, also emphasized this during his session at Atlassian presents: Unleash. He explained the importance of understanding the limitations of DORA metrics. For instance, setting a goal to increase deployment frequency, without considering the underlying challenges, can backfire. He shared a compelling example: a team that shifted from weekly to daily deployments without addressing the fragility of their deployment process ended up more stressed and less productive. Instead of pushing for higher deployment frequency, focusing on the stability and success rate of deployments would have been more beneficial.</p>



<p>In this example, Goodhart&#8217;s Law comes into play, which states that when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. By setting a goal to move deployment frequency by a certain amount, the manager mistook the measure for what they actually cared about: shipping software.</p>



<p>Dev teams can create scorecards in Compass for their software components to track performance using custom metrics. This flexibility enables teams to define healthy levels for metrics like deployment duration and deployment success rate, ensuring they focus on what truly matters and not just arbitrary targets.</p>

</div></figure>



<p><strong>Beyond AI – leverage internal developer platforms to improve knowledge sharing</strong></p>



<p>No single tool, even those enhanced with AI, can address all the unique engineering problems faced by an organization. Therefore, it&#8217;s essential for developer platforms to be extensible, allowing developers to customize and address their specific challenges.</p>



<p>Andrew highlighted the need for platforms that empower developers to overcome specific obstacles, enhancing their productivity and contributing to a more efficient and effective development environment. Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) should also enable developers to integrate and leverage GenAI tools effectively as they are significant data sources.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>So, how do you implement an IDP within your organization? Here are some actionable tips:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="1">
<li>Reduce cognitive load by using a component catalog to store all necessary information about software components, such as team ownership, contact channels, and dependency details. This centralized approach fosters a culture of self-service, reducing the need for information requests and simplifying onboarding.</li>



<li>Automate compliance with standards by implementing dynamic scorecards to communicate and enforce standards at scale. This integration into the daily workflow ensures developers are aware of governance expectations without attending additional meetings or searching for standards.</li>



<li>Simplify infrastructure setup by using templates to streamline cloud infrastructure and tool configurations according to company standards. This reduces setup time and potential errors, allowing developers to focus on high-value tasks.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Pair-tools-and-processes-to-improve-developer-experience"><strong>Pair tools and processes to improve developer experience</strong></h3>



<p>While AI tools are revolutionizing developer workflows by automating repetitive tasks and reducing technical debt, they are not a standalone solution. To fully harness their benefits, organizations must set realistic expectations, use phased rollouts, and combine qualitative and quantitative data. Leveraging internal developer platforms like Compass, combined with strategic use of AI tools, can further streamline processes, and ensure a more efficient and effective development environment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Misalignment between engineers and their leaders is possibly the leading cause of a sub-optimal developer experience and, consequently, poor productivity.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/compass/resources/state-of-developer-2024">See for yourself here</a></p>



<p>Thankfully, we have moved on from a time when a positive developer experience meant buying a few ping-pong tables and ordering pizza on a Friday. Leaders understand that improving developer experience is about removing friction from the developer&#8217;s daily work and is a key input to productivity and retaining talent. But how closely do leadership attitudes match with what developers experience?</p>



<p>We partnered with <a href="https://getdx.com/">DX</a>, an engineering intelligence platform that leading companies use to measure and improve developer productivity, and Wakefield Research to survey over 2,100 developers and managers across a range of industries worldwide. This gave us a fresh look at what keeps work flowing smoothly vs. what introduces friction in software development teams.</p>



<p>Our research shows that 97% of developers are losing significant time to inefficiencies, and the majority think about leaving their jobs due to a poor developer experience. Engineers and leaders agree on the importance of a positive developer experience, but there is less alignment on what needs to be improved.</p>



<p>An example of the disconnect between engineers and their leaders is highlighted by the differing perspectives on AI. Leaders believe AI is the most effective way to improve productivity and developer satisfaction, while two out of three developers say they aren&#8217;t experiencing significant productivity gains from using AI tools yet. Despite the best intentions, disconnects like this create the potential for significant investment and effort to be spent on initiatives that don&#8217;t meaningfully improve the developer experience or productivity.</p>



<p>Here are some of our main takeaways from the research.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Developers-are-losing-significant-amounts-of-time-to-friction">Developers are losing significant amounts of time to friction</h2>



<p><strong>Sixty-nine percent of developers are losing eight hours or more per week to inefficiencies</strong>. That&#8217;s <strong>20% </strong>of their time<strong>. </strong>While this is shocking, perhaps more alarming is that less than half of them believe their leaders are aware of this issue. Similarly, <strong>less than half think their organization prioritizes developer experience.</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left">How many working hours a week developers lose to inefficiencies:</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1480" height="1060" src="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/csd-11201-1-pie-chart-working-hours.png" alt="" class="wp-image-62067" srcset="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/csd-11201-1-pie-chart-working-hours.png 1480w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/csd-11201-1-pie-chart-working-hours-300x215.png 300w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/csd-11201-1-pie-chart-working-hours-600x430.png 600w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/csd-11201-1-pie-chart-working-hours-768x550.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1480px) 100vw, 1480px" /></figure>



<p>They aren&#8217;t wrong—there is a misalignment between developers and leaders on the issue. Most developers attribute their time loss to tech debt or insufficient documentation, while leaders point to understaffing, the expansion of the developer role, and the amount of tech knowledge needed. Not only does this create frustration among developers, but it also means leaders are likely to fix the wrong issue. The consequences are a larger gap in the issue and potentially wasted resources.</p>



<p>Additionally, most leaders admit the metrics they track are inefficient at measuring developer productivity, and most appear to conflate productivity and experience. This is unfortunate, given that developer experience is important to 63% of developers when considering whether to stay in their current jobs. Two out of three consider leaving their roles when they aren&#8217;t satisfied with their developer experience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Investing-in-developer-experience-is-a-virtuous-cycle">Investing in developer experience is a virtuous cycle</h2>



<p>While productivity and experience are intertwined, they are also highly contextual—there isn&#8217;t one metric or a set of metrics that rules them all. At Atlassian, we&#8217;ve invested heavily in developer experience with the goal of putting developers at the center of the process. As a result, developer satisfaction has risen 25 percentage points over the past two years (from 49% to 74%).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How important developer experience is to developers:</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1480" height="764" src="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/csd-11201-2-graph-dev-experience.png" alt="" class="wp-image-62068" srcset="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/csd-11201-2-graph-dev-experience.png 1480w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/csd-11201-2-graph-dev-experience-300x155.png 300w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/csd-11201-2-graph-dev-experience-600x310.png 600w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/csd-11201-2-graph-dev-experience-768x396.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1480px) 100vw, 1480px" /></figure>



<p>Focusing on <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/engineering/the-key-to-unlocking-developer-productivity">developer joy</a> can take your developer experience to the next level. Less time lost to obstacles and inefficiencies correlates with higher satisfaction with developer experience investment, meaning not only does productivity improve, but employee sentiment improves as well. The very first step for tracking, measuring, and improving developer experience is to <strong>speak with your developers</strong>. You can&#8217;t begin to help them unless you truly understand them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="What-about-AI?">What about AI?</h2>



<p>Leaders believe AI is the most effective way to improve productivity and satisfaction, but currently, <strong>two out of three developers aren&#8217;t seeing significant productivity gains from using AI tools</strong>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Top areas leaders believe will improve both developer productivity and satisfaction (multiple choice question):</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1480" height="764" src="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/csd-11201-3-graph-productivity-satisfaction.png" alt="" class="wp-image-62069" srcset="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/csd-11201-3-graph-productivity-satisfaction.png 1480w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/csd-11201-3-graph-productivity-satisfaction-300x155.png 300w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/csd-11201-3-graph-productivity-satisfaction-600x310.png 600w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/csd-11201-3-graph-productivity-satisfaction-768x396.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1480px) 100vw, 1480px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How much AI tools are improving developer productivity today:</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1480" height="764" src="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/csd-11201-4-graph-ai-tools.png" alt="" class="wp-image-62070" srcset="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/csd-11201-4-graph-ai-tools.png 1480w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/csd-11201-4-graph-ai-tools-300x155.png 300w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/csd-11201-4-graph-ai-tools-600x310.png 600w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/csd-11201-4-graph-ai-tools-768x396.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1480px) 100vw, 1480px" /></figure>



<p>AI has the potential to enhance the engineering craft by addressing tech debt, reducing developer toil, helping plug documentation gaps, and reducing interruptions. However, to understand how AI can improve developer joy, leaders must go beyond code generation to understand the needs of each area separately and design effective solutions that match. It is critical that leaders ask developers about friction points and then implement tools that create consistent feedback loops, a manageable cognitive load, and the ability to get into a flow state.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Using-the-data-to-improve-developer-experience">Using the data to improve developer experience</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s not all doom and gloom. This research allowed us to provide recommendations for leaders on measuring and improving productivity in a way that addresses developers&#8217; concerns. And the best strategy to understand how to improve the developer experience is also the simplest.</p>



<p>Developers want to be productive; if you ask them what needs to be improved, they will definitely tell you. Trying to improve developer experience without asking developers what needs to be improved is the equivalent of searching the house for your phone while it&#8217;s in your hand. Alignment between engineers and their leaders on what needs to be improved is a critical step in prioritizing precious effort toward initiatives with the greatest impact.</p>



<p>With developers facing increased complexity and companies facing tighter budgets with more pressure to maximize productivity, improving <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/devops/developer-experience-more-important">developer experience is more important</a> than ever. Improving alignment between developers and their leaders increases the likelihood of organizations meaningfully improving developer experience, productivity, and overall company success.</p>



<p>Progress toward improving developer experience is not linear—there will inevitability be events or incidents that impact sentiment. The important thing is that developers feel their challenges are understood and that they are enabled to do their best work. This is an ongoing process at Atlassian, too, but we will keep pressing forward and sharing what we learn through blogs, events, and reports like this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Since Atlassian Intelligence launched last year, customers like FanDuel, Workato, and Ovo Energy (over 30,000 and counting!) have been taking teamwork to new heights. They report saving an average 45+ minutes a week, demonstrating how AI can augment human performance.</p>



<p>But as we’ve said from the beginning, this is just that: the beginning. Today, we’re excited to announce more Atlassian Intelligence capabilities that are generally available across our cloud platform, as well as sneak peeks of what’s coming soon!</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s dive into 10 new ways Atlassian Intelligence optimizes how individuals work, how teams collaborate, and how organizations harness their data to deliver value.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1.-Generative-AI-in-the-editor">1. Generative AI in the editor</h2>



<p><em>Create versatile content that fits your workflow</em></p>



<p>Early adopters love using our AI-enhanced editor in Confluence, Jira, and Jira Service Management to get to a first draft faster, find action items, and improve their writing. Now, Atlassian Intelligence in Trello and Bitbucket helps users generate pull request summaries, release notes, and other key pieces of information.</p>



<p>Coming soon, the AI-enhanced editor will be available in Jira Product Discovery. You’ll also be able to reference other Confluence pages and Jira tickets in your prompts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2750" height="2030" src="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-03-04-at-11.06.56 am-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-60496" style="width:840px;height:auto" srcset="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-03-04-at-11.06.56 am-2.png 2750w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-03-04-at-11.06.56 am-2-300x221.png 300w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-03-04-at-11.06.56 am-2-600x443.png 600w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-03-04-at-11.06.56 am-2-768x567.png 768w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-03-04-at-11.06.56 am-2-1536x1134.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2750px) 100vw, 2750px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bitbucket pull request summaries<br></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2.-AI-powered-summaries">2. AI-powered summaries</h2>



<p><em>Summarize information, banish feedback fatigue, and get lightning-fast context on other teams&#8217; work</em></p>



<p>Atlassian Intelligence already offers AI-generated summaries in Confluence and Jira Service Management that help teams get up to speed quickly so they can take immediate action. Now, you’ll be able to get smart summaries across your apps too, including Atlassian apps and other popular ones such as Google Docs.</p>



<p>And soon, comment summaries are coming to a Confluence page near you. With AI page catch-up, you’ll get relevant detail and context on the latest changes to a page. Perfect for when you’ve been out on vacation or are onboarding to a new project.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2928" height="1580" src="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-20240423-215839-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-60497" srcset="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-20240423-215839-1.png 2928w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-20240423-215839-1-300x162.png 300w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-20240423-215839-1-600x324.png 600w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-20240423-215839-1-768x414.png 768w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-20240423-215839-1-1536x829.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2928px) 100vw, 2928px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">AI page catch-up in Confluence</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3.-Loom-AI-workflows">3. Loom AI workflows</h2>



<p><em>Video messaging: the next best thing to being just down the hall</em></p>



<p>Ever tried to explain how to reproduce a bug or how to request time off? Then you know: sometimes showing is easier than telling. But when you’re working distributed, at scale, or both, it’s not a matter of simply popping down the hallway for a demo.</p>



<p>That’s where Loom’s AI workflows will soon come in. They may not be an Atlassian Intelligence feature, but these <a href="https://support.loom.com/hc/en-us/articles/11331500832157-Loom-s-AI-Suite">AI-powered capabilities</a> were too good for us to leave out! They can transform your videos into Jira issues, Confluence pages, and step-by-step guides that can be customized for various audiences. Here’s what you will be able to do with Loom AI workflows:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Report a bug, fast: </strong>When a bug is documented with a <a href="https://www.loom.com/">Loom</a> video, Loom AI workflows auto-populate Jira issues from your demo. It will even auto-capture console logs, network requests, and more – so your devs can fix bugs even faster.</li>



<li><strong>Easily document your processes: </strong>Streamline onboarding and training when you use AI workflows to create accurate documentation in Confluence. AI workflows follow the steps outlined in your video to craft SOPs, step-by-step guides, and more.</li>



<li><strong>Improve code reviews:</strong> Replace live code reviews with a Loom, then watch as AI workflows auto-generate pull request descriptions, code docs, or QA steps from your transcript.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2928" height="1580" src="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-60548" style="width:840px;height:auto" srcset="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12-1.png 2928w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12-1-300x162.png 300w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12-1-600x324.png 600w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12-1-768x414.png 768w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12-1-1536x829.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2928px) 100vw, 2928px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Loom AI for Jira<br></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4.-AI-in-whiteboards">4. AI in whiteboards</h2>



<p><em>Turn ideas into action</em></p>



<p>Kick off a workshop or jam session by brainstorming ideas on a Confluence whiteboard. Atlassian Intelligence will pull from Jira Product Discovery insights, Jira tickets, and Confluence pages to generate ideas and create virtual sticky notes for them. Then, AI helps you organize by grouping similar ideas together on your whiteboard. When you’re ready, you can move the project forward by converting your whiteboard into a Confluence page, or a Confluence page into Jira tickets.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2928" height="1848" src="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-20240423-220340-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-60499" srcset="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-20240423-220340-1.png 2928w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-20240423-220340-1-300x189.png 300w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-20240423-220340-1-600x379.png 600w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-20240423-220340-1-768x485.png 768w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-20240423-220340-1-1536x969.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2928px) 100vw, 2928px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">AI in Confluence whiteboards</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5.-AI-work-breakdown">5. AI work breakdown</h2>



<p><em>Let AI cut big tasks into bite-sized pieces</em></p>



<p>Say goodbye to creating issues one by one and let Atlassian Intelligence do the heavy lifting. Simply choose what issue type you want suggestions for, and AI work breakdown makes suggestions for breaking epics into issues, or issues into sub-tasks. After you customize and approve, all the work items are created and properly nested. AI work breakdown has started rolling out in beta, and will be available to all users soon.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2928" height="1604" src="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/related-resources-slide-1-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-60500" srcset="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/related-resources-slide-1-2.png 2928w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/related-resources-slide-1-2-300x164.png 300w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/related-resources-slide-1-2-600x329.png 600w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/related-resources-slide-1-2-768x421.png 768w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/related-resources-slide-1-2-1536x841.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2928px) 100vw, 2928px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">AI work breakdown in Jira</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6.-AI-issue-reformatter-and-related-resources">6. AI issue reformatter and related resources</h2>



<p><em>For polished, easy-to-understand issues</em></p>



<p>It’s easy to lose time in the back-and-forth between teams and functions. Soon you will have the tools to solve the root cause: Jira issue clarity. Whether it&#8217;s adjusting how issues are formatted or including that extra bit of information, ensure you have a good hand-off experience with issues that are well-understood and actionable by everyone.</p>



<p>AI issue reformatter, a generative AI prompt option, reviews and rewrites issue descriptions in a consistent framework to structure work for clarity –&nbsp;whether it’s steps to reproduce for a bug, acceptance criteria for features, or formatting steps needed to complete a task in an easy to follow way.</p>



<p>Related resources help teams reduce time spent having to check multiple places to find the relevant context for a task, by automatically finding and surfacing key information from across your tools and documentation and linking it to a Jira issue.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1464" height="924" src="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/frame-1171276234-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-60501" srcset="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/frame-1171276234-1.png 1464w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/frame-1171276234-1-300x189.png 300w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/frame-1171276234-1-600x379.png 600w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/frame-1171276234-1-768x485.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1464px) 100vw, 1464px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Issue reformatter in Jira</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="7.-Virtual-agent-in-the-help-center">7. Virtual agent in the help center</h2>



<p><em>Exceptional service where and when you need it.</em></p>



<p>Since implementing Jira Service Management’s toolset, including Assets and Virtual Agent, FanDuel has been able to cut support tickets that require human intervention by a whopping 85%.</p>



<p>And it’s only going to get better. Virtual Agent will soon be available in Microsoft Teams and the help center inside Jira Service Management, as well. Just type a question in the help center search box and AI will fetch the answer, along with links to related resources.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="3024" height="1698" src="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/jsm_virtual-agent-smart-ans.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-60502"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Virtual agent in Jira Service Management help center</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="8.-Natural-language-AI-automation-rules">8. Natural language AI automation rules</h2>



<p><em>Automate the tedium away, no coding required</em></p>



<p>Using natural language to create automation rules makes fast work of a time-consuming task.&nbsp;Simply describe what you’d like to automate, and AI will generate the rule for you. Customers who’ve used AI to create rules in Confluence have already automated 5x as many tasks as those who haven’t.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Imagine all the time they’re saving! You can use natural language to build automation rules now in Confluence, Jira, and Jira Service Management.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2920" height="1792" src="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-2-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-60503" srcset="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-2-2.png 2920w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-2-2-300x184.png 300w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-2-2-600x368.png 600w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-2-2-768x471.png 768w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-2-2-1536x943.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2920px) 100vw, 2920px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Natural language in Automation rule builder for Jira</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="9.-AIOps">9. AIOps</h2>



<p><em>Power through your incident management workflows</em></p>



<p>First there was DevOps. Then came ChatOps, and even <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/statuspage/be-kind-during-downtime-send-hugops-love-today-and-every-day">HugOps</a>. Now, get ready for AIOps in Jira Service Management –&nbsp;essential for on-call heroes who need to separate the signal from the noise amidst a flurry of alerts. Atlassian Intelligence will soon help teams group similar alerts together, detect patterns, and suggest potential root causes. It will also soon be able to recommend resources such as runbooks and knowledge-base articles for time-saving solutions, as well as automate post-incident reviews to help you prevent recurring incidents.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2880" height="1720" src="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alert-ai-view-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-60504" srcset="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alert-ai-view-1.png 2880w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alert-ai-view-1-300x179.png 300w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alert-ai-view-1-600x358.png 600w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alert-ai-view-1-768x459.png 768w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alert-ai-view-1-1536x917.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">AIOps alert grouping in Jira Service Management</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="10.-AI-chart-templates-and-insights-in-Atlassian-Analytics">10. AI chart templates and insights in Atlassian Analytics</h2>



<p><em>Visualize and interpret your data with ease</em></p>



<p>Teams already use Atlassian Intelligence to transform natural language questions into SQL in Atlassian Analytics, making it easy to dig through data regardless of technical skills. Now AI helps you interpret your data in natural language, too. When you create a chart (we’ve got new templates for that, by the way), AI search insights provide a brief description, along with helpful notes about trends so you can act on your data with greater confidence.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2928" height="1848" src="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-12-copy-4-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-60505" srcset="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-12-copy-4-1.png 2928w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-12-copy-4-1-300x189.png 300w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-12-copy-4-1-600x379.png 600w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-12-copy-4-1-768x485.png 768w, https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-12-copy-4-1-1536x969.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2928px) 100vw, 2928px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">AI chart insights in Atlassian Analytics</figcaption></figure>

<p>The post <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/introducing-atlassian-rovo-ai">Unlock enterprise knowledge with Atlassian Rovo</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog">Work Life by Atlassian</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Generative AI is critical to unleashing the potential of all teams, and we’re excited to use this revolutionary technology to improve the way teams work. A year ago, we launched <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/artificial-intelligence">Atlassian Intelligence</a> to help teams boost productivity with AI.</p>



<p>Since then, we’ve turned our attention to using AI to solve the highly complex problem of enterprise search and knowledge discovery. Our goal is to enable you to turn Atlassian and third-party data from across your organization into actionable insights and knowledge-driven decisions. In this age of generative AI, every team member deserves to have superpowers, and we want to make sure we deliver them.</p>



<p>Consider this: “47% of digital workers struggle to find the information or data needed to effectively perform their jobs”, according to a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-05-10-gartner-survey-reveals-47-percent-of-digital-workers-struggle-to-find-the-information-needed-to-effectively-perform-their-jobs">recent survey by Gartner</a><sup>(r)</sup>. This is not surprising given large companies (2,000+ employees) use <a href="https://www.okta.com/resources/whitepaper-businesses-at-work/thankyou/">over 230 apps</a> on average. With bodies of enterprise data this vast, valuable knowledge gets trapped in information silos –&nbsp;a costly problem that gets worse by the minute. Imagine having a simple solution to not only locate precisely what you need but also understand its relevance to your work and how to act on it, without switching across different tools.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Enter,-Atlassian-Rovo">Enter, Atlassian Rovo</h3>



<p>Powered by <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/artificial-intelligence">Atlassian Intelligence</a>, Rovo is a new product that helps you turn information into action in a heartbeat. It accelerates finding, learning, and acting on information dispersed across a range of internal tools:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Find: </strong>Search across data, tools, and platforms (yes: even your third-party apps and, ultimately, home-grown systems) to get contextual and relevant results within your Atlassian experience.</li>



<li><strong>Learn:</strong> Gain a deeper understanding of your company’s data through AI-driven insights, knowledge cards, and AI chat for deeper data exploration.</li>



<li><strong>Act:</strong> Add specialized agents to workflows to handle time-consuming tasks, complete projects, and help solve complex problems.</li>
</ul>



<p>But AI is only as useful as the data it taps into. We’ve made it our business over the past 20+ years to understand how teams work: common patterns, anti-patterns, organizational structures, and lines of communication. All that knowledge has been poured into a proprietary common data model we call “teamwork graph.” This is the secret sauce that makes Rovo, and all our other AI capabilities, so special. Teamwork graph pulls in data from your Atlassian tools and other SaaS apps you choose to connect, unlocking a comprehensive view of your organization’s goals, knowledge, teams, and work. With every new tool connection, team action, and project event, teamwork graph draws more connections and expands its knowledge to deliver increasingly relevant results.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Find-answers-faster-with-an-AI-powered-search">Find answers faster with an AI-powered search</h3>



<p>Rovo Search surfaces the most contextual and relevant results, no matter where the data is stored or the format it takes. It understands what your teams are looking for and provides comprehensive insights from across your enterprise systems.</p>



<p>Want to know if a project is on track? Rovo can provide a robust answer in seconds by searching across all your Atlassian content as well as the third-party content you select – from issues in Jira to the myriad of files stored in Google Drive to the Sharepoint document you’d forgotten about. We’re even building Search to query custom in-house applications, such as those developed for finance or HR, to deliver relevant answers for any team or industry.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video autoplay controls loop src="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/blog_find.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Search across all your selected SaaS apps, even custom data sources, all within the Atlassian Experience</figcaption></figure>



<p>Here’s how Rovo Search works:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Actionable results from across all your content:</strong> Identify team members with the necessary expertise to contribute to a project’s success, or uncover related topics to develop a deeper understanding of the project. Search helps teams swiftly find the exact information you need across huge volumes of complex data. If you choose, Rovo Search can pull information from popular tools, including Google Drive, Microsoft Sharepoint, Microsoft Teams, GitHub, Slack, and Figma, to deliver even more comprehensive answers.</li>



<li><strong>Bring your industry-specific and custom-built apps, too:</strong> Rovo’s API will be designed to let you connect niche and home-grown apps. So even if you’re a manufacturer with a custom database or a pharmaceutical company tracking bioinformatics, we’re looking out for you.</li>



<li><strong>Enterprise-grade permissions</strong>: Search results are personalized and contextual. Permissions are fully respected so employees see only the information they’re supposed to see, while restricted data remains private. Administrators have full control over the enablement of search connectors and data access.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Superpower-your-workflows-with-virtual-teammates">Superpower your workflows with virtual teammates</h3>



<p>Rovo Agents will transform teamwork with their ability to synthesize large volumes of enterprise data, break down complex tasks, learn as they take action, and partner with their human teammates to make critical and complex decisions. Agents aren’t just some souped-up version of chatbots. They bring specialized knowledge and skills to a wide variety of workflows and processes. Agents can:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Generate, review, and refine content for marketing and PR communications, product specs, goal descriptions, and more</li>



<li>Automate and streamline tasks such as creating a design for new requests, taking action when a Jira issue progresses, or reviewing content after it&#8217;s created</li>



<li>Answer questions, recommend best practices, integrate UX research into Jira specs, create service checklists, or contribute to custom knowledge bases</li>



<li>Help with onboarding new employees, building team gratitude, and facilitating team collaboration</li>



<li>Streamline time-consuming tasks like cleaning up Jira backlogs, organizing Confluence pages, or aligning content to formatting specs</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls loop src="https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/comms-crafter-1080.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Agents are your virtual teammates who collaborate with their human teammates to solve complex problems and move work forward (Comms Crafter agent shown above)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Agents are tailored to a company’s knowledge and act on additional instructions while always keeping their human teammates in the loop. Here’s how they work:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Built with accountability in mind</strong>:<strong> </strong>Admins control whether agents are enabled for their organization. Whether they’re working with humans, other agents, or both, agents report back as they move through workflows so you remain in the driver’s seat.</li>



<li><strong>Teammates when and where you need them</strong>: Agents exist within a team&#8217;s workflow, and can be configured to take action based on a specific trigger, such as an issue created, a comment made, or at a recurring time.</li>



<li><strong>Versatile and easy to create</strong>: We expect Rovo to include over 20 agents out-of-the-box. Organizations can also create bespoke agents using Atlassian&#8217;s no-code text interface or with Forge, our extensibility platform. In addition, teams will be able to explore a wide variety of agents on the Atlassian Marketplace, with more than a dozen already in progress from popular vendors.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Recently, Atlassian held <a href="https://events.atlassian.com/highvelocity"><em>High Velocity: ITSM</em></a>, an event covering ways to reimagine service management to include teams beyond IT. Atlassian customers joined in to discuss their journeys to digital transformation by way of Jira Service Management.</p>



<p>During High Velocity’s keynote address, Atlassian Co-Founder Scott Farquhar sat down for a chat with Domino’s Pizza Enterprises Ltd (Domino’s) Group Chief Technology Officer Matthias Hansen and the NRMA’s General Manager of Technology Engineering Andy McCarthy to discuss their ITSM journey.</p>



<p>Let’s walk through key findings from these customer journeys to Jira Service Management, the benefits they’ve found from their new approach to service management, and their advice for other teams kicking of a digital transformation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="NRMA’s-journey-to-Jira-Service-Management"><strong>NRMA’s journey to Jira Service Management</strong></h4>



<div class="wp-block-atlassian-tip tip"><h6 class="atlassian-tip--headline">Fast facts:<br></h6><div class="wp-block-atlassian-tip">
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>100-year-old Australian member-owned roadside assistance network</li>



<li>2.8 million members, 2000 employees, and handles 1.4 million calls per year</li>



<li>Leader in sustainability</li>
</ul>
</div></div>



<p>Though the NRMA had been using Jira Software and Confluence as the backbone of their software delivery, they had still been using ServiceNow as an ITSM platform. According to Andy McCarthy, the lack of integrability created challenges across the organization, “it never hooked into what we needed it to hook into” and ended up becoming “a bubble by itself.” Since data silos and obstacles to collaboration can permeate into a slowed service delivery, the NRMA which is an emergency roadside service, needed to make a change.</p>



<div class="wp-block-bitbucket-quote bitbucket-quote-callout text-center undefined"><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-sm-9"><blockquote class="bitbucket-quote-callout--blockquote"><p class="bitbucket-quote-callout--text">We had good knowledge of what [ServiceNow] could do, but we didn’t know how it worked. It was very much ‘we can see it but we can’t touch it, and if we had to touch it, we had to get someone in to touch it for us.’ So the run costs were quite substantial, and we had no in-house skill to run it.”</p><cite class="quote-callout--cite">– Andy McCarthy, General Manager of Technology Engineering, the NRMA</cite></blockquote></div></div></div>



<p>Given their familiarity with Atlassian products, Andy and his team chose Jira Service Management for their ITSM solution. Jira Service Management was uniquely suited to plug into their existing work streams while being easy to scale without third-party support.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="Domino’s-journey-to-Jira-Service-Management"><strong>Domino’s journey to Jira Service Management</strong></h4>



<div class="wp-block-atlassian-tip tip"><h6 class="atlassian-tip--headline">Fast facts:</h6><div class="wp-block-atlassian-tip">
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Largest pizza company in the world – 3800 stores across 12 markets with 100,000 employees</li>



<li>Last fiscal year Domino’s cooked 8 pizzas per second or 256 million pizzas</li>



<li>Visual AI to ensure right toppings</li>
</ul>
</div></div>



<p>The sun never sets on Domino’s – with locations across the globe, Domino’s has to deliver consistent service every second of every day. This takes a lot of moving pieces such as live GPS tracking of delivery drivers or visual AI to ensure orders are made correctly.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, before finding their way to Jira Service Management, Domino’s had to juggle 6 different ITSM tools globally. Matthias Hansen’s team was already using Jira Software, and decided to unify their dev and ops teams on one connected platform with Jira Service Management.</p>



<div class="wp-block-bitbucket-quote bitbucket-quote-callout text-center undefined"><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-sm-9"><blockquote class="bitbucket-quote-callout--blockquote"><p class="bitbucket-quote-callout--text">The Jira Software and Jira Service Management integration has been instrumental to really have this end-to-end view on the technology side”</p><cite class="quote-callout--cite">– Matthias Hansen, Group Chief Technology Officer, Domino’s Pizza Enterprises Ltd</cite></blockquote></div></div></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="How-the-NRMA-benefits-from-Jira-Service-Management"><strong>How the NRMA benefits from Jira Service Management</strong></h4>



<p>With Jira Service Management in place, it is much easier to communicate and collaborate across departments. Andy’s team was also pleased to find unanimously warm feedback from his teams due to its user-friendly interface which empowered employees to get more from their tools and take control. Teams now had the power to build and develop workflows themselves without having to learn any specialized skills or leverage an expensive vendor.</p>



<p>Andy also found that his business teams were happy with the standardized nature of the platform for its increased level of dialogue and resolution speed. The savings also ended up being a big win as the NRMA was able to reduce its ITSM run costs by 50%.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-bitbucket-quote bitbucket-quote-callout text-center undefined"><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-sm-9"><blockquote class="bitbucket-quote-callout--blockquote"><p class="bitbucket-quote-callout--text">We can actually play with it ourselves and build our own workflows without having to bring in the third parties that then would talk to [ServiceNow] and charge us a big bill. So being able to scale up in-house internally and build those workflows was very important to us”</p><cite class="quote-callout--cite">– Andy McCarthy, General Manager of Technology Engineering, the NRMA</cite></blockquote></div></div></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="How-Domino’s-benefits-from-Jira-Service-Management"><strong>How Domino’s benefits from Jira Service Management</strong></h4>



<p>After transitioning to Jira Service Management, Domino’s was able to use one service desk for all 12 markets and 3,800 stores across the globe. Matthias also notes that having the same platform for both the engineering and business teams drives efficiency and end-to-end visibility. Back when there were different ITSM tools across regions, there would be gaps between IT information gathering and engineering team work.</p>



<p>Domino’s has since found Jira Service Management easy to use and extend. As they continue to standardize processes it allows them to automate the backend of these processes easily, further improving speed, quality, and removing repetitive manual work.</p>



<p>Matthias is also excited about new features such as <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/artificial-intelligence">Atlassian Intelligence</a> and has already seen improvements to productivity. Matthias already sees its use for report summaries, sharing that his knowledge manager had already been saving roughly 2.3 hours in the first week that they enabled the feature. Domino’s support teams have also seen results using the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-management/features/itsm/virtual-agent">Virtual Agent</a> feature, allowing them to elevate service when issues arise and avoid tickets in the first place.</p>



<div class="wp-block-bitbucket-quote bitbucket-quote-callout text-center undefined"><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-sm-9"><blockquote class="bitbucket-quote-callout--blockquote"><p class="bitbucket-quote-callout--text">I can just click Summary and I got this five page long PIR report and I’ve got five sentences summarizing it for me”</p><cite class="quote-callout--cite">– Matthias Hansen, Group Chief Technology Officer, Domino’s Pizza Enterprises Ltd</cite></blockquote></div></div></div>



<p><strong>Streamlining digital transformation: Advice for customers embarking on digital transformation&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Towards the end of the fireside chat, Scott asked both customers if they had any advice for enterprises looking to embark on their digital transformation process. Here’s what they had to say:</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="NRMA:"><strong>NRMA:</strong></h5>



<div class="wp-block-bitbucket-quote bitbucket-quote-callout text-center undefined"><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-sm-9"><blockquote class="bitbucket-quote-callout--blockquote"><p class="bitbucket-quote-callout--text">I would recommend [Jira Service Management] if you’re looking for something to bring things together internally and halve your costs, that’s what we did” </p><cite class="quote-callout--cite">– Andy McCarthy, General Manager of Technology Engineering, the NRMA</cite></blockquote></div></div></div>



<p><strong>Domino’s:</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-bitbucket-quote bitbucket-quote-callout text-center undefined"><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-sm-9"><blockquote class="bitbucket-quote-callout--blockquote"><p class="bitbucket-quote-callout--text">My advice would be to standardize on one platform, one thing I’ve noticed since the pandemic is that there are lots of good SaaS platforms but the challenge is you end up with the legal team using one set of tools, another team in another country using another tool, and [previously] I never had the critical mass to actually support the business properly.”</p><cite class="quote-callout--cite">– Matthias Hansen, Group Chief Technology Officer, Domino’s Pizza Enterprises Ltd</cite></blockquote></div></div></div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="Looking-forward"><strong>Looking forward</strong></h4>
