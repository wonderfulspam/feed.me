   <media:description>Today I'd like to introduce you to a small project I've recently published. The &quot;Brainmade&quot; Mark is something I will be attaching to any works of mine that were mostly made by me or my friends, not by generative AI tools like GPT.
I've built a small website at http://brainmade.org with high-resolution black or white versions of the logo available for download and attaching to your own projects if you'd like to.

I want to be clear about my reasoning for building this: 
I don't hate AIs, I love humans!

   <media:description>Compiler-Driven Development in Rust, including TDD, CDD, and the Typestate Pattern.

Today's sponsor: Quadratic, check them out at https://quadratichq.com/?utm_campaign=noboilerplate

When I write a new Rust program, I don't start with functions or methods or any runtime code. I start with the model of my application, expressed with Rust's rich type system.
Interacting with the real-world, on disk or through the network is too slow for me, at first, I need to iterate faster than that, to sketch out my ideas, unconstrained by the outside world.

This compile-checked whiteboarding I call Compiler-Driven Development.

   <media:description>What do you think of the subtle per-chapter background images I've tested in this video? Tell me in the comments!
I have grown from an autistic child who needed weekly lessons from a childhood psychiatrist in order to learn how to make eye contact, into an autistic adult who is flying high in an aeroplane made out of comprehensive coping mechanisms.
The way I have made sense of my life, is to find repeated patterns and groupings of traits, the same as we do for the night sky. There does appear to be a unifying autistic core trait, however, which surprised me: 
Detail-oriented thinking.

   <media:description>Alternate Title: NixOS: Stability on the Bleeding-Edge
One day, as happens now and then with a bleeding-edge rolling release distro, a systemd update reversed my mouse buttons.
The great thing about rolling-release and cutting-edge distributions like Arch Linux, is that you get to be a beta tester, whether you like it or not!
I thought this was the way it had to be on Linux: Stability or cutting-edge features, not both.
But that wasn't right at all, with NixOS you can have everything, everywhere all at once!

   <media:description>Alternate title: Rust's Hidden Purity System
I was taught formal methods at university but these ultra-safe development techniques are expensive, require using unusual external verification languages, and most damning for web and application developers, they slow down iteration.
After graduating and getting a webdev job, I despaired that the safety and guarantees of the formal systems that I had been introduced to weren't available to me as a web developer.
I was going to have to act if I wanted to live in a different world.

Hi folks! A topic I hinted at in my &quot;Plain Text&quot; video after saying, &quot;But even if you're storing large files, storage is cheap if you're smart.&quot;

We live in an incredible age, computers have never been so fast, nor storage so cheap, but it doesn't feel like it, right?
It's not you, computing has been getting worse. And the problem is LAPTOPS.

Hi folks, this video is about ADHD, and is my follow-up from my &quot;Hacking Your Brain With Elaborate Coping Mechanisms&quot; video[1].

Despite not being left-handed, I do have a great deal of empathy for our left-handed cousins because of my ADHD: Some tools, like scissors, you can get a left-handed version of, of course. You can fill your house with physical coping mechanisms that help you function.

But when you walk out into the world, you will find that nearly everything isn't designed for you.

   <media:description>Hi friends, if you like my fast, technical videos, I think you might like my podcast, Modem Prometheus too!

Though the stories include monsters, ghosts, and magic, they also include radio static, summoning APIs, and, most terrifying of all:
Project managers.

Crossposted into the main NB feed is your typical Halloween story of meddling managers, unrealistic requirements, and, of course, the horrors of debugging.</media:description>

   <media:description>All good teams are alike; each bad team is bad in its own way. (to paraphrase Tolstoy)

Software is an incredible thing.
Combined with the internet, a small team of friends can change the world overnight.
Every company, no matter what their industry, must now run a tech team, even if only to maintain their website.

So why are they all so bad at it?

   <media:description>The Cult of Done manifesto was written in 2009. I read it that same year, as the ideas swept through the maker community.
https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13

I think of many of the 13 principles every single day, as I write these videos, produce my audio fiction podcasts, and write music or code for any of my projects.

This framework has changed my life for the better, and now I'd like to share it with you.

Programming is the purest form of applied mathematics.

The machinery of the Rust language is built on the simple rules of functional programming and borrow checker.
Starting with good rules is a profound way to build a language.
You don't have to invent an error handling system in such a language.

You can discover it.

   <media:description>Most of my meals are meal replacements, nutritionally complete drinks or instant meals, and they have been for the last 10 years.
These tools are incredible for a lot of reasons, from convenience to health to price.
I have tips and recommendations to figure out if you should look at integrating these tools into your life, and also what brands work for me.

   <media:description>Today I'm going to make some web service recommendations, mixing some of my favourite rust crates together into something that I use across most of my Rust projects.
The stack I'm going to talk about today isn't the best stack, nor most fully featured or fanciest.
It's my favourite stack, it showcases what rust is GREAT at, and it focusses on correctness above all else.

   <media:description>I have used many note-taking tools over the years, simple-note, notion, and extensively emacs org-mode, none have improved my thinking in the way that Obsidian has.
Today is a deep-dive into my second brain, and if you take my advice, YOUR second brain.
